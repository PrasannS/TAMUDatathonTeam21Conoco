This project has 3 sections, a django server hosted on GCP App Engine, where we deployed our best-performing AI model, a cross-platform flutter application (works on iOS and Android) that visualizes data in real-time, provides insights, with direct hits to the GCP server. Finally, the most important part, the machine learning and jupyter notebook, where we used and tested a variety of models to come up with our final one.
